# Solar System in Three.js

## Project Overview
This project is a 3D visualization of the Solar System created using **Three.js**, a popular JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. The aim is to provide an interactive and educational experience for exploring celestial bodies, including the Sun, planets, and their satellites.

## Features
- Realistic 3D models of the Sun, planets, and moons.
- Orbital paths to represent planetary movements.
- Interactive controls for zooming, rotating, and panning the camera.
- Textures to enhance the realism of celestial objects.
- Modular structure for easy expansion and customization.
