# Solar System in Three.js

## Project Overview
This project is a 3D visualization of the Solar System, designed using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. The primary objective is to create an interactive and educational scene representing the Solar System, showcasing the motion and features of celestial bodies such as the Sun and the planets.



## Key Features
- Realistic modeling of planets and the Sun, utilizing geometric transformations and textures to enhance visual fidelity.
- The inclusion of defining elements, such as Saturn’s iconic rings, rendered with texture mapping techniques.
- Dynamic planetary motion, where each planet orbits the Sun and rotates on its axis.
- Interactivity through keyboard controls, allowing users to adjust the speed of planetary movements.
- A focus on maximizing the number of Solar System objects present in the scene, excluding satellites for simplicity.
- The project aims to balance scientific accuracy with interactive design, making it an engaging tool for exploring the mechanics of the Solar System.
